Data analysis from Master School Project using [Globox Database](postgres://Test:bQNxVzJL4g6u@ep-noisy-flower-846766-pooler.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/Globox)
The objective is to analyse which version of website in A/B testing that users convert more. Then, two aspects, which are average spending and conversion rate, are analysed using [spreadsheet](https://github.com/schavisa/MSProject-Globox/blob/master/DataAnalyst_GloboxSpreadsheet_Chavisa_Sep25.xlsx). Moreover, power analysis and novelty effect are examined for more support. As a result, there is no significant different between control and treatment group for average spending but there is **significant** different on coversion rate. However, after power analysis and novelty effect assessment, it shows lacks and inconsistency of dataset. Therefore, the suggestion is to continue collect data until it shows more consistency and adequacy of data.
